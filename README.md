# 📺 TCSS460-Group5-FrontEnd

This repository contains the Group 5 Front-End application for the TCSS 460 course project. This web interface provides an interactive platform for discovering and ranking TV shows and movies, connecting to our assigned TV show, Movies, and Credentials API backend.

## 🎯 Overview

Our web application allows users to interact with comprehensive TV show and movie information. Users can search, filter, view detailed information, and manage their entertainment preferences all in one place.

The standout feature of our application is the **personalized Top 10 ranking system**. Rather than simply browsing content, users can create custom-themed Top 10 lists that reflect their unique tastes and preferences.

**Example Top 10 Lists:**
-  My Top 10 Action Movies
-  My Top 10 Shows of 2024
-  My Top 10 Netflix Originals
-  My Top 10 Comfort Watches
-  My Top 10 Underrated Gems

### 🔄 How It Works

1. **Create a List Category** - Define your custom theme or category
2. **Search the Database** - Use provided API endpoints to search by:
   - Genre
   - Release year
   - Title/name
   - Network/platform
   - And more...
3. **Select Your Favorites** - Browse results and pick shows or movies
4. **Rank Your Top 10** - Arrange your selections in your preferred order
